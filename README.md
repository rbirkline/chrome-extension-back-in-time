# chrome-extension-back-in-time

This project was inspired by a friend.  His son wanted to hear what a modem would do and wanted to visualize the connection to the internet as we did in the past.

## How to test yourself.

1. Download the extension for Chrome.
2. Go to "More Tools" > "Extensions" and enable "Developer Mode"
3. Click on "Load unpacked"
4. Select the folder for where the unpacked extension is.

## Special thanks
